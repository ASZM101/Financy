# 💸 Financy 💸

_**Frontend Repository**_

Financy is a project compiled by Nathan Lee and Adriana Zambrano for TAMU Hack 2024. It is a budget tracker and financial literacy hub for information. This repository contains the frontend for this project, written in SwiftUI. The backend can be found in [this](https://github.com/theavgeekbee/tamu2024backend) repository.

## ✨ Inspiration ✨

We were thinking about how a lot of people in today's society are financially illiterate.
We created ***Financy*** as a solution to this problem.

## 🤖 What It Does 🤖

__Financy__ is a budget tracker that also has short articles that help you
on your financial goals.

## 🏗 How We Built It 🏗

We used Swift UI to build a simple yet powerful frontend for iOS devices. We also wrote a backend in Rust to deploy a REST API quickly and efficiently using Rocket.

## 🧩 Challenges We Ran Into 🧩

We were very limited in the number of features we could do because in addition to time constraints, we also only had 2
people on our team. In addition to that, our frontend developer didn't know Rust and our backend developer didn't know
Swift UI. We overcame these challenges by efficiently communicating the specifics about the API routes, what we wanted
for the backend, and how the UI should be designed in the front end. We also ran into an issue with GitHub where we lost
all of our front-end code at one point. We
overcame this challenge by remaking the app from memory.

## 🏆 Accomplishments That We're Proud Of 🏆

This was our first hackathon, and we had a lot of challenges to overcome with the amount of work to be split among 2
people. We were both equally proud of:

- How quickly the UI design was made
- How speedy all the routes for the API were written

Overall, we were pleased by how efficiently our code was written and fully completed.

## 📖 What We Learned 📖

We learned that we need to have more concurrency in the programming languages that we know, so that in the future, when
someone is done, or not doing anything, they can help program and finish it instead of doing busywork that is usually
reserved for the end of the hackathon, like presentations and Dev Post submissions.

## 👀 What's Next? 👀

In the future of __Financy__, we hope to expand to more platforms, as well as write more articles.
